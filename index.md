### Clustering of Movies based on Mood/Genre


### Project Description
I will focus on training a Neural Net (NN) on the clustering of movies based on their genres. There are many online databases that contain lists of movies and tags associated with them. These databases can be used to train the NN and let the NN cluster the movies based on the similarities of their genres.

The trained NN will be deployed as an application in a website, allowing a user to pass in a genre to be provided with movies of that genre or similar. If time allows and the project is going well, the project can be extended by implementing a light front end interface that gets the genre of a movie not in the database, then passes that back to the NN for analysis.

The longer term goal is to improve the NN to cluster more accurately (e.g. action and adventure, or horror and thriller clustered closely together), and ensure that the NN doesn't only recommend movies of the exact same genre as what is provided. Additionally, the movie's art can be included an analyzed through multimodal clustering that includes both text descriptions and art qualities.

### Project Goals
1. Find a movie database with genre tags for every movie.
2. Ensure dataset has large variety of genres.
3. Train neural net to cluster movies by genre.
4. Explore improvement of clustering to include similar genres, not just genres of the same type.
